                            Your resume should be no longer than 1-2 pages. Keep
                            it to 1 page if you have less than 8 years of
                            professional work experience. If you have more, you
                            might consider using 2 pages.

                        <li>
                            Include a skills section - it's incredibly
                            important. This step will prove highly valuable if
                            the company uses ATS (applicant tracking system).

                            Unless otherwise specified by the company or the job
                            description, submit your resume in pdf format. You
                            can convert this file to pdf in google docs by going
                            to File, select Download, and then pdf.

                            Write 2-5 bullet points for each position, depending
                            on the duration and relevance of the position. Keep
                            sections that are less relevant to the job you're
                            applying to short.

                            Your most recent position should have the most
                            bullet points, as long as the position is relevant
                            to the one you're applying for.

                            continuous tense and describe past roles using the
                            past simple tense.

                            It's not enough to describe what you have done or
                            your areas of responsibility, you need to quantify
                            the impact of your work. Recruiters scan resumes for
                            numbers, so quantify as much as you can.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You can talk about xx% improvement your initiatives
                            yielded.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Or you could mention the increase in company revenue
                            of xx% that your work contributed to.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Avoid writing bullet points that are longer than 2
                            lines. No recruiter will read bullet points that are
                            as long as paragraphs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Carefully review your resume several times to
                            eliminate any typos. Additionally, consider having
                            someone else proofread it to prevent sending an
                            imperfect resume.

                            Be consistent with grammar. Generally, resumes
                            should be written in the past tense. The exception
                            is if you're describing your current position with
                            ongoing responsibilities.

                        <li>
                            If you're a fresh grad with limited work experience
                            you can move the education section to the top of the
                            page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you have 5-8 years of work experience, do not
                            include internship experience in your resume unless
                            highly relevant.
